When playing complex minecraft modpacks, sometimes its hard to find how much ressources you need before
you can craft complex endgame items
<s>I have never used Vue js before, this is as new to me as it is to you.</s>

## Getting Started
:warning:**UNDER REWORK**  :warning:
## Informations

What can you see:
- All the items used in saved recipes
- How many of each items are **used**.
- How hard of each item is to **craft**.
- Links between ingredients and results.



## Installation

> ‚ùó Since this project in actively developed (well, not anymore)

At home how to guide :

1. Run **Any minecraft version** with the following mods:
    * [Just Enough Calculation](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/just-enough-calculation)
    * [CraftTweaker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafttweaker)
    * [Icon Exporter](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/iconexporter)
2. Create some recipes ingame with **Crafting Calculator**
    * Export recipes. They appear in MC folder `[MC_FOLDER]/config/JustEnoughCalculation/data/groups.json`
    * Open [resources/node_parser.js](resources/node_parser.js) and set path variable `GROUPS_PATH` to this file
3. Create list of **OreDictionary** entries:
    * In game run command `/ct oredict`
    * Open `[MC_FOLDER]/crafttweaker.log`
    * Scroll to end of file and save all lines starts from `Ore entries for [...]` to file [resources/rawData/crafttweaker.log](resources/rawData/crafttweaker.log)
4. Create **Spritesheet** with all icons
    * In game run command `/iconexporter export` (works only in single player)
    * Download and run [Texture Packer](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker). It can be used for free.
    * Drag and drop folder `[MC_FOLDER]/icon-exports-x32` in program, adjust `Max Size` and chose `Framework` to `JSON (Array)`
    * Publish Spritesheet. Put `json` to [resources/rawData/sheet/Spritesheet.json](resources/rawData/sheet/Spritesheet.json) and `.png` to [resources/Spritesheet.png](resources/Spritesheet.png)
5. Run `node_parser.js` with **Node.js**. This would update [parsedData.json](resources/parsedData.json) and [groups.json](resources/groups.json)

**Hint:**
You dont need to do steps `3` and `4` if you play [Enigmatica 2: Expert](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/enigmatica2expert), because icons and OreDict entries are basicly same as predefined in repo.

Recipe making recomendations

* Use most **common** ingredients. For example better to craft pistons from copper plates

* Adds variants with better yields of recipes, avaliable in the **progression** tab.

For example, wood planks should be proccessed in machines with a x6 yield instead of x2, and metal plates should be made from 1 ingot, not 2

* Move press molds and other not actually comsumed items to **catalysts** section

* It would be cool if you add additional **catalysts** that actualy used in recipe. For example pedestals or energy for charged draconium

* Use **Placeholders** when recipes require more slots than avaliable. TreeVisualizer will automatically replace all placeholders with the required ingredients

* Some recipes have no other inputs except time. Make Placeholder for **Ticks**. Also output can be chanced
